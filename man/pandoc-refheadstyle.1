.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pandoc\-refheadstyle [\-h]
pandoc [...] \-F pandoc\-refheadstyle [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle\fP sets a custom style for the reference section
header, that is, if the metadata field \fBreference\-section\-title\fP has been
set to a non\-empty value.
.sp
By default, the reference section header will be assigned the custom style
\(aqBibliography Heading\(aq. But you can assign another style by setting the
metadata field \fBreference\-header\-style\fP to the name of a style of your
choice. If the style does not exist, it will be created.
.sp
\fBpandoc\-refheadstyle\fP identifies the reference section header as the
first element, starting from the end of the document, that meets all of
the following three criteria:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
It\(aqs one of the last five top\-level elements of the document.
.IP 2. 3
It\(aqs a level\-one header.
.IP 3. 3
It\(aqs header text is the one set in \fBreference\-section\-title\fP\&.

.sp
A reference section header that was inserted by \fBpandoc\-citeproc\fP
will meet all of those criteria.
